# Layered-Pine-Tree
## Project 1 of CS 141 (UIC): Layered Pine Tree

This was one of my first pieces of code in C++. It allows users to create a visual representation based on their input.

### Features:
- Display a `"HELLO"` ASCII graphic using a character of the user's choice.
- Generate a layered pine tree with customizable layers and trunk size.

### Usage Instructions:
1. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your character for the ASCII graphic and specify the layers and trunk size for the pine tree.
