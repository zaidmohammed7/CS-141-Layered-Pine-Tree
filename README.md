# Layered-Pine-Tree
Project 1 of CS 141 (UIC): Layered Pine Tree

This was one of my first pieces of code in C++

It is a simple code that can do two things depending on the user input:
1. Display a "HELLO" ASCII graphic using a character of the user's choice
2. Display a layered pine tree with the number of layers and size of trunk specified by the user
